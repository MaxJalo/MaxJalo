## 1. I’m MaxJalo, a Computer Vision Developer

I am a **Computer Vision and Machine Learning developer** working on applied CV problems and production-oriented ML projects. I have experience across the full ML lifecycle: data processing, model development and training, experiment tracking, pipeline orchestration, deployment, and system integration.

I focus on building **robust, reproducible, and scalable ML solutions** that work in real-world conditions.
